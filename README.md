# Personal Website
This is a personal portfolio website I have designed and created for myself. 
This website is merely a chance for me to practice and learn new skills.

### Resources Used
I'm also using this to learn Sketch for UI Design and Blocs 3 for HTML editing.
Tasks included integrating web standards, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
Versioning (Git, via GitHub and GitLab), and efficient web design practices.
